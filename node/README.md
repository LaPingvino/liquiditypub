# lpnode — Profile-A reference node (PoC 1)

A single Go binary implementing the LiquidityPub v0.2 contact surface
(`../docs/PROTOCOL.md`), Profile A (active server, §12). It is the first
proof-of-concept for the epic tracked in beads as `joop-eci`.

## Design in one paragraph

Every arithmetic the protocol pins is delegated to the `conformance` package —
this node imports it directly, so pool pricing, channel hashes, the UD formula,
JCS canonicalization, ed25519 signing, envelope validation, and the transfer
state machine are the spec's own reference code, not a re-implementation. What
lives here is the *shell*: an append-only, hash-linked, double-entry ledger
(`ledger/`), the contact/transfer orchestration, the HTTP bindings, and a
federation client. Storage is a stdlib-only in-memory ledger (no external
dependencies) behind a small surface, so the Cloudflare-D1 (`joop-n7j`) and
GAE (`joop-3mu`) ports have a clean seam to slot a different backend into.

## Run it

```
go run ./cmd/lpnode demo        # two in-process nodes, full round trip + checks
```

`demo` binds two localhost nodes, opens a seeded contact, transfers in both
directions, then runs the black-box `lpconform` checks and verifies both ledger
chains. Expected tail: `ALL GREEN`.

Serve a single long-running node and point the conformance runner at it:

```
go run ./cmd/lpnode serve -addr 127.0.0.1:8092 -base http://127.0.0.1:8092 \
    -name Hilltop -currency "Hill Credits" -symbol H -members bob:100000000
go run ./cmd/lpnode serve -addr 127.0.0.1:8091 -base http://127.0.0.1:8091 \
    -name Riverside -currency "River Credits" -symbol R -members alice:100000000 \
    -peer http://127.0.0.1:8092

# from ../conformance:
go run ./cmd/lpconform http://127.0.0.1:8091 http://127.0.0.1:8092
```

## Definition of done (AGENTS.md) — status

1. `cd ../conformance && go test ./...` stays green — vectors untouched. ✅
2. The pure core imports `conformance` directly. ✅
3. `lpconform <node-url>` passes against a running instance. ✅
4. Two instances open a contact, transfer both ways, cross-check shows matching
   channel roots and op_seq. ✅ (`demo`, and the `serve` + `lpconform` pair.)
5. Ledger invariants under test: `SUM(entries)=0`, node wallets never negative,
   reserves a pure function of op history. ✅ (`go test ./...`.)

## Endpoints (read surface is mirror-friendly, §5.1/§8.3/§9.2)

| Path | Spec |
|---|---|
| `GET /.well-known/liquiditypub` | identity document (§3) |
| `POST /lp/inbox` | push binding (§5.2) |
| `GET /lp/outbox/{peer-host}.json` | pull binding (§5.1) |
| `GET /lp/checkpoint.json` | signed checkpoint (§8.3) |
| `GET /lp/log/head.json`, `GET /lp/log/` | hash-linked log (§9.2) |
| `POST /admin/{contact,transfer,ud}` | out-of-protocol driver for demos |

## Known PoC-scope limits (for the next iteration)

- Persistence is opt-in: `serve -state <file>` (or `lpnode.Restore` / `SetStore`
  with a `store.Store`) snapshots the full node — ledger, contacts, transfers,
  channel bookkeeping, outboxes, keys — after every state change, durable
  *before* the change is observable, and resumes from it on restart. The
  `store.Store` interface is the seam the D1 (`joop-n7j`) and GAE (`joop-3mu`)
  profiles back with their own KV/blob. Default (no `-state`) is in-memory.
- Both transports work: push (§5.2) and the pull baseline (§5.1, `serve -pull
  <cadence>`, `Node.PollPeer`/`StartPulling`). Outbox pruning against a peer's
  published `last_seq_processed` is not implemented yet (an optimization).
- Auto-accept of contacts and genesis member grants are demo conveniences, not
  protocol requirements (both are node-internal policy under the membrane).
- `reserve.adjust` (§8.4) is implemented: consensual liquidity top-ups /
  withdrawals (`serve` admin `/admin/adjust`, `Node.AdjustReserve`), folded into
  the channel hash as an operation.
- Key rotation (§3, `Node.RotateKey`/`RevokeKey`, `key.announce`) and
  `contact.close`/`contact.update` (§6) are implemented, keyring persisted.
  Verifier-side revocation enforcement (pruning a peer's revoked key) still
  relies on out-of-band re-verification per §13 — a node does not yet
  auto-refetch a peer identity doc to drop revoked keys.
- Sealed outboxes (§5.1, EXPERIMENTAL) are deliberately deferred per DESIGN §10.
